TUESDAY NOTES

____________________________________


Custom Header Files:

    #include "mylibrary.h"

    --> includes library of custom functions
    --> Goal: Reuse Functions

Header Files:

    By default, C includes no function libraries
    Add only the ones needed in the program,
    in order to save memory and make the executable smaller.

Variable Storage Class:

    the following keywords put simply before variable type:

    ex. static double pi = 3.14159
    ex. register int x;
    ex. extern int y;

    auto:
        default storage class for all local variables
        storage automatically created/reserved upon function call
        variable dies when function terminates

    static:
        exist as long as program is running
        can only be referred to when execution is in block in which
        they are defined

        For example, if variable is changed first time function
        is called, and you call it again, the changed value from 
        the first call will continue to be stored and the program
        will change the changed value from the first call.

    extern:
        denotes variable declared/initialized in other file

    register:
        denotes variable that is heavily used and should be kept
        in machine register to increase speed and efficiency

        this is a bit of a hack on gcc, and is not advisable
        register is usually only for reserved variables

Scope:


    File Scope:
        Things declared outside all of program's blocks
        ex. #define PI 3.14
        
    Function Scope:
        
    Block Scope:

Recursion:

    Using function that calls itself to solve subproblems same form as initial problem


    int factorial (int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        return n * factorial(n-1);
    }

    1. Identify Base Case
    2. Find Algorithm/Formula to solve subproblems
