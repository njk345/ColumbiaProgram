Pointers:


    * operator: "dereference operator"
        
        int x;
        x = 3;

        int *y;
        y = &a;

        dataType *ptrName;
        ptrName = &varName; //ptrName is pointer to other variable's address


        pointer points to 0 or NULL (latter preferred), or to address

        pointer to address:
            points to beginning of memory spaces containing the variable
            pointed at.

        ex. 
        int x = 3;

        int *ptrx = &x
        *ptrx = 5; //sets x to 5

    & operator: "reference operator"

        "Address" in memory of variable that comes after it

    * and & are opposites

    


    ex.

    int i = 6;
    int j;
    int *p;
     
    p = &i; //p points to i, which is 6
    j = *p; //j equals contents of mem. at address of i, which is pointed to by p
    printf("%d %d\n", i, j);
    *p = 4;
    printf("%d %d\n", i, j);




    char *name = "I am a string";
    --> Creates pointer to a char array that is initialized in same line.


    format specifier for pointer = %p
