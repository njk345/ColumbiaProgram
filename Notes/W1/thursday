THURSDAY NOTES


MORNING

Arrays:

    Block of variables of same data type
    Store in consecutive memory addresses
    Size is static
    
    Declaring Arrays:
            
        datatype name[size];

        ex. int x[4];
            float myArray[19];

        for array of ints, each element is 4 bytes

        access nth element:
            array[n];

    Initializing Arrays:
            
        int n[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}; //array size 5 is filled

        int n[5] = {1}; //0th element is filled, rest are filled by 0's


    Strings:

        arrays of chars, where last element is always '\0'

        char s[6] = {'H','e','l','l','o',\0};

        If you want to make string length 5, declare it as length 6
            --> null byte needs a space

        strcpy(s1,s2):
            

        strcmp(s1,s2):

        strcat(s1,s2):

        strlen(s):
            returns length of string not including null byte

        fgets(s,sizeof(s1),stdin):
            reads string from keyboard, stores in s.
            counts '\n' as part of the inputted string, so length will be one more

        scanf("%s",s):
            reads sring from keyboard, stores in s.
            reads until it sees '\0', and therefore does not include '\n' as part of string.
            strlen of string read through scanf will be one less than string from fgets

        sscanf(s,"%d",&var):
  




  AFTERNOON
  _______________________________________________

  Loops:

    while loops (same as any other language):

    for loops (same, but counter variable must be declared before):
    ex.
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            stuff;
        }
