TUESDAY NOTES

Import non-standard C libraries:

	include "library.h"

Import standard C libraries:

	#include <library.h>



Global Declarations:

	#include's
	function main
	variables
	statements
	etc...

Constants:

	#define NAME value
	ex. #define MAX 100


Ints:

	int x = -12;
	unsigned int y = 15;
	short x = 2;
	long x = 20000;

	Memory:
			
		short - 2 bytes
		long - 4 bytes
		int - 4 bytes
		signed range = -2^31 -- 2^31
		unsigned range = 0 -- 2^32

Chars:

	char c = 'w'; ALWAYS SINGLE QUOTES
	ASCII representation of character in base 2
	
	Memory:
		1 byte (always) 

Floats:

	float f = 3.14
	
	Memory: 
		4 bytes

Doubles:
	double d = 3.14159

	Memory:
		8 bytes


Overall Memory:

	char = 1 byte
	int = 2 or 4 bytes
	unsigned int = 2 or 4 bytes
	short = 2 bytes
	long = 4 bytes

Casting Variables:

	float x;
	int y;
	y = 3;
	x = (float) y;
	--> x = 3, and is now 8 bytes rather than 4

sizeof function:

	return number bytes held in variable inputted
	int x = 2345;
	--> sizeof(x) = 4;

AFTERNOON


printf():


	Escape Characters:
		\n = new line
		\t = tab
		\' = single quote
		\" = double quote

	Format Characters:
		%d = int
		%ld = long int
		%s = string
		%f = float
		%c = char

Prefix and Postfix Incrementing:

	x++  --> x = x+1
	
	x = y++  -->   sets x to y+1 ONLY THE NEXT TIME Y IS REFERENCED
	
	x = ++y  -->   immediately updates y and set x to it
	
	ex. int x = 5;
	    int y = 6;

Order of Operations:
	
	prefix increment
