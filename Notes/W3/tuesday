TUESDAY NOTES

MORNING
_________________________________________________


Linked Lists:

    Struct With member that is pointer to another struct, etc.

    Ends with a struct whose pointer points to NULL, not another struct

    First struct in list is called "head"

    List must be traversed from head to tail over every element, when accessing an
    arbitrary index.


    Insert New Node:

        struct Node *newptr;

        newptr = (struct Node *) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));

        //notice how malloc uses 1 * sizeof(struct Node);
