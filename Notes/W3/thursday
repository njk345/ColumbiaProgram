Files and Streams:


    -C views each file as sequence of bytes until EOF marker seen.
    -EOF = End of File

    File Variables:

        FILE *file_name;  //declares a file

    Open File:

        file_name = fopen(file_name, mode);

        Modes:
            -r = read
            -w = write
            -a = append
            -b = binary
            -r+ = read and write
            -w+ - read and write, fileName created if didn't exist

        fopen() returns NULL if file not found

    Close File:

        fclose(file_name);

        -returns 0 on success
        -returns non-zero on error

    Read Functions:

        fgetc(file_name);

        -read single character, returns EOF if end of file reached

        fgets(char *string, size_t size, File *fvar);

        -read string, one line at a time (can be used for any stream)

        fscanf(File *file, "....format stuff", &var...);

        -reads one line in formatted manner
