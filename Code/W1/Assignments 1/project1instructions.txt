		Data analysis: customer satisfaction survey

/********************************************************************/
Write a program that computes the median, mean and mode for the 
following scenario:
You are given the results of a customer satisfaction survey of 
99 people in an array named:

	unsigned int responses[99];  

Each response is a number from 1..9.

For example, response[82]=5, means that the customer with id=82 has 
scored the service provided with grade 5.

1. For testing your code, you can create a sample responses array 
by generating 99 random numbers x (where 1<x<9) using the rand() 
function.

2. You need to create functions 
	mean(),   /* Calculates the average of all values in responses[]*/
 	median(), /* Median is the middle value of all 
		     the responses if the values are sorted in 
		     ascending/descending order.
		     Hint: You need to put the elements of the array in 
		           ascending order to be able to find the median.
			   Create a function for that!                 */

	mode()   /*  The value that occurs most frequently among the 
		     responses*/

4. Specifically in the case of mode, apart from the result, 
your program should also print out the histogram of the frequency 
for all the available responses (1..9).

Eg.

/***************
     MODE
***************/
Response       Frequency      Histogram
   1              5 		*****
   2              7		*******
   3              3             ***

etc.

5. Your code needs to be properly commented and follow the proper C 
program structure we have discussed in class. It should inlcude also the
good programming practices we have been talking about.
You should include a README.txt describing how to run your code,
if it takes any input and a small summary (if needed)
of what your code does. Alternatively, you can comment your code properly.
Finally, the output should be clearly formatted such as 

/**********
    MEAN
**********/

- What mean is?

- The result!
